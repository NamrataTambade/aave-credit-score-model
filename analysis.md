## üî¢ Score Distribution

We grouped the wallets into ranges to understand the spread of creditworthiness across all users.

| Score Range | Number of Wallets | Behavior Summary                        |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 0‚Äì100       | 428               | Very high-risk, often liquidated         |
| 101‚Äì200     | 689               | Risky, few or no repayments              |
| 201‚Äì400     | 1384              | Irregular behavior, high borrow ratio    |
| 401‚Äì600     | 2041              | Average, some repayments and deposits    |
| 601‚Äì800     | 2392              | Mostly healthy behavior, some risk       |
| 801‚Äì1000    | 3066              | Very reliable, frequent repayments       |

üß† Wallet Behavior Insights
üîª Low-Scoring Wallets (0‚Äì200)
Frequent borrow actions with no or very few repay transactions.

Multiple instances of liquidationcall, indicating loan defaults.

Very short activity spans (e.g., one-day flash activity).

Possibly exploitative or bot-driven behavior.

‚ö†Ô∏è Mid-Range Wallets (400‚Äì600)
Some healthy behavior like repay and deposit, but inconsistent.

Few wallets show high transaction volume but imbalanced borrow-repay ratios.

Possible overuse of borrowing without consistent repayment.

üîº High-Scoring Wallets (800‚Äì1000)
Strong repay-to-borrow and deposit-to-redeem ratios.

Long activity spans‚Äîindicating continued use over time.

Little to no liquidation history.
